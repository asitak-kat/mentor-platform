MentorMe is a platform to facilitate mentoring within the company.
It's goal is to help employees with learning of technologies that
are used within the company, or that are company specific.

Note: the project currently consist mainly of the MentorMePitch.pdf, 
further things in the docs are basically notes, etc

Advantages:
 - Finding a mentor is easy:
    - No intimidating going around asking who can help and when,
    - Scheduling of an appointment just takes a few clicks
 - The technology is explained by someone who is using it in an exact
   same setting
 - Helps building a company's comunity:
    - Apart from learning the technology, people in the company are
    meeting and learning about their projects
 - And many more

Further notes:

How the app picks a mentor:
 - depends on company's decision
 - can be somebody with whom the potential mentee has a lot of time
   overlap
 - or somebody who the mentee might already know - e.g. from the
   same team, or located nearby.
