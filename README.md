MentorMe is a platform to facilitate mentoring within the company.
It's goal is to help employees with learning of technologies that
are used within the company, or that are company specific.

We worked on the project very tightly together, discussing desing, 
how we make the pitch, create the slides, etc.
Zoia did a lot on motivating the business model, Katerina proposed 
the pitch strategy and the story, and paper draft of the slides, 
Sarah did most of the slides creation. And we were constantly 
checking with each other, and discussing details.

Note: the project currently consists mainly of the MentorMePitch.pdf, 
further things in docs folder are basically notes, etc.

Advantages:
 - Finding a mentor is easy:
    - No intimidating going around asking who can help and when,
    - Scheduling of an appointment just takes a few clicks
 - The technology is explained by someone who is using it in an exact
   same setting
 - Helps building a company's comunity:
    - Apart from learning the technology, people in the company are
    meeting and learning about their projects
 - And many more

Further notes:

How the app picks a mentor:
 - depends on company's decision
 - can be somebody with whom the potential mentee has a lot of time
   overlap
 - or somebody who the mentee might already know - e.g. from the
   same team, or located nearby.
